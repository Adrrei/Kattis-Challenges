#### Kattis upgraded their hardware on February 22nd, 2018:  
> "[We have made a major upgrade to new, faster, judging hardware](https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-hardware-up-17137873). The time limits for all problems have been updated to reflect the new faster runtimes. Over the next weeks we will be rejudging old submissions and as a result you may see some of your old submissions suddenly become Accepted or, alas, stop being Accepted. The rejudgements of old submissions will tentatively be finished by March 2."
